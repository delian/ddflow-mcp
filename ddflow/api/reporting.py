    The shape B37 is about: ONE description of the result, from which both surfaces
    derive their view. `cmd_loops` used to build the JSON body and the human paragraph
    independently — two renderings of one answer, kept in step by hand, which is how
    `cmd_complete` came to print a coverage gap to humans only.

    Exit stays as it was: 1 when there are findings, 2 when there are none. "Loops
    found" is a finding rather than a tool failure, but that contract is what callers
    already branch on and changing it silently would be worse than its imperfection.
